 - __Common Law__: traditional law that is not written down, but which depends on the judgement of judges over the centuries. When deciding the rights and wrongs of a case, a court will look at the way in which similar cases have been decided in the past; such cases are known as _precedents_. (USA, Commonwealth)

         * The Queen (_royal assent_)
     + __Act__: After the bill was approved by House of Commons and House of Lords. The queen cannot refuse to give royal assent. Acts of Parliament constitute what is known as _primary legislation_.
     + __Green Paper__: Government may want to canvass opinion before creating a bill. Explains why the government wants to create new laws in a certain area and discusses a number of possible approaches. The green paper will be discussed by Parliament and comments on it will be invited from the public and from bodies that have an interest in the area (e.g. BCS).
     + __White Paper__: describes the proposed legislation and will be used as the basis for discussing and possibly modifying the details of what is proposed. At the end of this process, the government will take into account these discussions and produce a bill.
